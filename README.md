# Fruit-Classifier
In this project I had to scrape images from the web and create my own dataset for 10 different fruit classes (Apple, Banana, BlueBerry, Cherry, Grape, JackFruit, Mango, Orange, PineApple, Strawberry) and then I tried out and compared different transfer learning models(VGG16, Inception, Exception, Resnet50). The best performing model was Xception(93.40 accuracy) and then I deployed my model using Gradio.
